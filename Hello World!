	Hello Wolrd!

Function delete userS always return 500

Error on /genericquerys/databases
	return 0 instead of 1
Shit happen when trying all database name with /genericquerys/{database}/schema
	template0 return error 500 + JSON with a space that put postman in the grave
Error on /genericquerys/{table_name}

Error while running delete user request with basic user accout. returned JSOn is empty and postman can't handle it (test stop).

There's "Unchanged yet" at Get Domain request 1st test line. Why ?

Error while running Update properties.
	Admin account is kick out of vitis_admin privilege


			With admin account first then Basic_user1 :


Get private token of admin account.
	Next request set to Get token.
	Init :
		time, i_user(not yet) and i_group variables to 0
	Set :
		user = admin ; password = admin ; bool = admin

Get token verify if token received equal saved one.

Add a "Basic_user" account and store it's user_id.
	Set :
		login, name, password, password_confirm = Basic_user
		privileges = vitis_user
	Clear :
		email, company, departement, groups
	Should I add 3 users like for the "group" ? Do same tests with one and a delete userS with the two left ?
		Only if delete userS is repair

Add 3 group named "Test_Group" + number(N, from 0 to 2) and store their name and id ("group_name" + (N) and "group_id" + (N)).
	Last group_id (group_id2) is store in environment group_id.

Update name from "Test_Group2" to "Test_Group_2" at group_id2

Get group and check if last update had been made

Delete group named "Test_Group_2"

Get groups and check if "Test_Group_2" had been delete.
	Group list should not be empty

Delete groupS remove "Test_Group0" and "Test_Group1"

Update user with new variables
	set :
		email = Basic_user@corp.com ; company = corp ; departement = 11223 ; privileges = vitis_user|vitis_admin

Get user check if update had been done on each updated field

Delete user from it's id




Get privilege info from vitis_admin

Update privilege. Should obviously do something, but well... life is life

Get privileges. Check what happen with update





Post domains. Add 3 domain named "Domain_+(N)" from 0 to 2
	Save last domain_id, domain, alias, server and port
	Should had a variable i_domain preset to 0
	set :
		domain, alias, server = "Domain_(N)"
		port = i_domain + 100

//Active directory tests

Update domain. add some info and change "Domain_2" to "Domain2"
	set :
		dn_search_user = Some_user ; filter_user = A_user ; dn_search_group = Some_group ; filter_group = A_group ; login = root ; password = toor

Get domain. Confirm/Check modifications on "Domain2" and unset of password

Delete domain = "Domain2"

Get domainS. Check if delete function had been correctly done.

Delete domainS remove "Domain_0" and "Domain_1"

Get querys // /genericquerys/databases
	store all database name and count (i_query++) them
		Nop, bad idea... + split doesn't work and if table empty, postman will stop running test
		Anyway it's possible to chain all query test by getting a data from previous request









Add user //loop with basic user ; save it's user id and set next request to "Get private token" if execute with admin else skip
	set :
		login, name, user, password, password_confirm = Basic_user1
		company = corp ; email = Basic_user1@corp.com ; departement = 22334 ; group = 1 // 1 = demo ; privileges = vitis_user

// Cleaning
